Java Script has 6 Primitive data types String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Symbol, Undefined, and Null.

All primitive types are immutable.  Except for Null and Undefined all primitive values have object equivalents that wrap around the primitive values.

ex:

valueOf() will return the primitive value
